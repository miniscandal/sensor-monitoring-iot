This file tracks pending tasks, planned changes, and technical cleanups. It’s organised by module or topic and helps guide ongoing development and prioritisation.



✰ Rename the message parameter in the notify method of mqtt-client-observer-manager because it does not represent an MQTT message.
✰ Rename the notifyStatusCode method and update its behavior, as it will no longer be limited to status codes but will handle any MQTT message in mqtt-client-observer-manager.
